# time-to-go
Command line tool to display upcoming NYC subway times on a Raspberry Pi OLED monitor

## Command Usage
Print next subway times to OLED display:
```
./time-to-go subway --stop-id YOUR_STOP_ID [--i2c-bus YOUR_I2C_BUS] [--least-minutes-ahead LEAST_MINUTES_AHEAD]
```

Print next subway times to terminal:
```
./time-to-go subway --debug --stop-id YOUR_STOP_ID [--least-minutes-ahead LEAST_MINUTES_AHEAD]
```

Print next bus times to OLED display:
```
./time-to-go bus --stop-id YOUR_STOP_ID [--i2c-bus YOUR_I2C_BUS] [--least-minutes-ahead LEAST_MINUTES_AHEAD]
```

Print next bus times to terminal:
```
./time-to-go bus --debug --stop-id YOUR_STOP_ID [--least-minutes-ahead LEAST_MINUTES_AHEAD]
```

Clear OLED display:
```
./time-to-go clear [--i2c-bus YOUR_I2C_BUS]
```

## Installing
1. Install Go on your Raspberry Pi, if you don't have it already
   
Follow [this guide](https://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi/install-go-raspberry-pi/) to install Go. I used ```go1.22.0.linux-arm64.tar.gz``` for my Raspberry Pi 4 running a 64 bit OS.

2. Download the repo to your Raspberry Pi
```
git clone https://github.com/christian-doucette/time-to-go.git
```
3. Build the executable

Navigate into the repo then run:
```
go build
```
This should create an executable ```time-to-go``` file

4. Test run (print to output)

At this point, try running the following command, using your MTA subway API key:

```
./time-to-go subway --debug --stop-id R16N
```
This will print the next subway times at stop R16N (Times Squareâ€“42nd Street NQRW) to output. If something goes wrong, resolve it before continuing.



 
5. Connect the OLED display

I used a 0.96 inch display with an SSD1306 driver connecting over I2C. Follow the beginning part of [this guide](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2018/04/i2c-oled-display-module-with-raspberry-pi/) for wiring and setup of the OLED display. If you want to use multiple monitors, follow [this guide](https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-PI-Multiple-I2c-Devices/) for adding additional I2C buses and wiring the additional displays. 


6. Test run (print to OLED display)

At this point, try running the following command:
```
./time-to-go subway --stop-id R16N
```

This should display the next subway times at stop R16N to your OLED display. If something goes wrong, resolve it before continuing.

You can run the following command to clear the display:
```
./time-to-go clear
```

7. Set up a Cronjob to run the command continuously

For a refreshing display, you will want to rerun the command every 30 seconds to ensure the OLED dispaly always has up to date info.

Edit cronjobs:
```
crontab -e
```

Add the following lines:
```
* * * * *            ~/Desktop/time-to-go/time-to-go subway --stop-id R16N
* * * * * (sleep 30; ~/Desktop/time-to-go/time-to-go subway --stop-id R16N)
```
Cronjobs can be run at most once per minute, so to run it every thirty seconds there are two Cronjobs kicked off on the minute, one which waits 30 seconds before execution.
- Switch ```subway``` for ```bus``` if you want to pull bus times instead of subway 
- Replace the stop-id argument with the ID of the stop you want to display (find a stop ID by name [here](https://github.com/christian-doucette/time-to-go/blob/main/internal/gtfs/stop-data)).
- Replace ``` ~/Desktop/time-to-go/time-to-go``` with the full path to the executable

If you are using multiple I2C devices on different buses, specify the buses (1 will be used as the default):
```
* * * * *            ~/Desktop/time-to-go/time-to-go subway --stop-id R16N   --i2c-bus 1
* * * * * (sleep 30; ~/Desktop/time-to-go/time-to-go subway --stop-id R16N   --i2c-bus 1)
* * * * *            ~/Desktop/time-to-go/time-to-go subway --stop-id R16S   --i2c-bus 3
* * * * * (sleep 30; ~/Desktop/time-to-go/time-to-go subway --stop-id R16S   --i2c-bus 3)
* * * * *            ~/Desktop/time-to-go/time-to-go bus    --stop-id 400265 --i2c-bus 4
* * * * * (sleep 30; ~/Desktop/time-to-go/time-to-go bus    --stop-id 400265 --i2c-bus 4)

```
